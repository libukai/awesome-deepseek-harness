## Quick Start

[DeepSeek Harness](https://deepseek.com/harness/) (also known as DSH or `dsh`) is an open-source Agent Harness project from DeepSeek AI. Built on [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis), it follows an **Everything is a Plugin** architecture: model adapters, tools, session logs, interfaces, and the Agent Loop can all be composed and replaced through a plugin tree.

### Launch the Web UI

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22.19.x or 24+ (24+ recommended), then run:

```bash
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default. Configure a model provider under **Settings → Models**, then create a session. See the [official quick start](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/guide/quickstart) and [model provider guide](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/guide/providers) for details.

### Run from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness.git
cd deepseek-harness
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm dsh web
```

### Use the Python SDK

The official Python SDK lets you call Harness programmatically through its bundled runtime, without requiring a system Node.js installation. It currently requires Python 3.10+. Refer to the [official Python SDK guide](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/guide/python-sdk) for supported platforms and current limitations.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install deepseek-harness-sdk
```

### Install Plugins

`web` and `headless` are built-in distribution Profiles. External plugins join a target Profile as Bundles that declare `dsh.bundle`:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add <package-or-git-spec>
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

When installing from a Git repository, pin a commit and inspect its installation scripts first. pnpm may require explicit approval for dependency build scripts, which execute outside the Agent sandbox. See the [official plugin packaging and installation guide](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/develop/basic/publish) for the complete mechanism.

Related project: [zevorn/dsh-humanize](https://github.com/zevorn/dsh-humanize) |
| [Thoughts After Participating in the DSH Private Beta](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?src=11&timestamp=1786637135&ver=6902&signature=f2kUSJauxSlkVXP-gNNPIRTnOpnLFlErLe4br99jXqa5DQMhCDnbDWewbtAMfQ6VIMH0W6Ac95tZ4VyWhtAVyNZawkPrsAw5igtwqPl5lNxNl8Mhd9tbuMK3IW%2AAvojR&new=1) | 减AI | The author explicitly states that they joined the beta and released [dsh-ads](https://github.com/Nagi-ovo/dsh-ads), [dsh-visualize](https://github.com/Nagi-ovo/dsh-visualize), and [dsh-find-plugins](https://github.com/Nagi-ovo/dsh-find-plugins); useful for understanding how early plugin authors viewed the ecosystem. |

### Community Discussions

Public long-form social posts with substantial arguments, practical detail, or first-hand context that supplement gaps in official materials.

| Post | Author and Context | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Understanding DSH from an Early Participant's Perspective](https://x.com/jiayuan_jy/status/2087911060154314963) | [Jiayuan (JY) Zhang](https://x.com/jiayuan_jy) · 2026-08-13; the author reports receiving repository access one month early | Frames DSH as both a working Coding Agent and an Agent development framework; uses a “LEGO car” analogy for Everything is a Plugin and discusses runtime self-extension, early self-evolving software, current maturity, and functional-programming characteristics. |
| [Understanding DSH as an Agent Runtime / Agent OS](https://x.com/anion_ex/status/2087910193783025853) | [Anionex](https://x.com/anion_ex) · 2026-08-13; private-beta participant and plugin author | Explains DSH through the composability of models, tools, policies, storage, context, interfaces, and Loops, then discusses limited Agent visibility into the runtime and controlled self-extension. |

## Third-Party Clients

The following projects provide standalone user interfaces, distribution formats, or productized assemblies rather than a single tool capability.

> **Classification note:** Distributions and forks directly reuse, modify, or repackage the complete DSH Runtime and cannot be installed with `dsh plugin`, so they are not plugins. Standalone clients connect to DSH through Web, RPC, ACP, or companion bridge plugins. Both remain important parts of the Harness ecosystem.

### Desktop Apps and Distributions

| Project | Platform / Form | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [TinyWhale](https://github.com/aimierbear/TinyWhale) | macOS · Electron · Distribution fork | Directly forks `deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness` and adds a desktop shell; connects to an existing Web UI or launches a full `dsh web` Runtime, so it is not a plugin |
| [Oh-DSH-Desktop](https://github.com/hust-open-atom-club/oh-dsh-desktop) | macOS · Electron | Extensible workbench bundling the DSH Runtime, Node.js, PTY, workspace tools, and a plugin-market preview |
| [DSH Desktop](https://github.com/dataelement/dsh-desktop) | macOS / Windows · Electron | Cross-platform desktop client for managing local Harness instances, workspaces, random ports, Profiles, plugins, and sessions |
| [DeepSeek Harness Desktop](https://github.com/Stxr/deepseek-harness-desktop) | macOS / Windows · Electrobun | Lightweight desktop shell that launches the official `dsh` Web Profile; bundles pinned Node.js, pnpm, and the full CLI while sharing `DSH_HOME` with the command line |
| [dsh-launcher](https://github.com/Ruler4396/dsh-launcher) | Windows · WebView2 | Lightweight launcher with silent startup, a standalone window, portable packages, and MSI distribution |

### Terminal, Mobile, and Web Experiences

| Project | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [dsh-TUI](https://github.com/ccch1mneyyy/dsh-TUI) | TUI Bundle | Claude Code-style full-screen terminal, streaming status, context instruments, and session rollback |
| [dsh-tianshu-tui](https://github.com/huiliyi37/dsh-tianshu-tui) | TUI Bundle | Complete terminal interaction layer evolved from Tianshu, with state driven by the DSH session event stream |
| [dsh-tui](https://github.com/openguardrails/dsh-tui) | TUI Bundle · Early | Supports local DeepSeek and offline use; under active development, and the pre-port test suite is not yet running |
| [Orbis](https://github.com/icodesign/orbis) | Mobile remote control · Beta | Uses a DSH plugin for device pairing, end-to-end encrypted transport, and real-time multi-device updates |
| [dsh-web-ui](https://github.com/zhu1090093659/dsh-web-ui) | Web UI collection | Collects task boards, Git Graph, mobile UI, skins, pets, runtime statistics, and other components |
| [dsh-web](https://github.com/Tom6814/dsh-web) | Docker Web · Early | Deploys a complete Web interface, workspace, and plugin market with Docker; development is moving quickly, and a data volume is required to persist configuration and sessions |
